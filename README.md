#BBj syntax highlighting and snippets for SubLime Text #

## Installation ##

To install the BBj syntax highlighting and code snippets for sublime, you'll need to copy the content of the /syntax and  /snippets into you sublime 3 user package.

**Windows** 
> C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 3\Packages\User\

**MAC OS**
>~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User/

**Note:** You can access the User package folder from Sublime when selecting : "Preferences" > "Browse Packages ...", then navigating to the sub folder "User"

###Syntax highlighting ###

Move the content of the /syntax folder to the sublime 3 User package folder, then restart sublime.
You should see a new sub menu in the syntax selection Menu called "User". Hover over this new menu, and select the BBj syntax for instance.

### Snippets ###

Copy the /snippets folder into the sublime 3 User package folder, and restart sublime. Now when using the BBj syntax, then typing a keyword like "println" should result in sublime showing the System.out.println() snippet which you can execute by hitting ENTER.
